# anthroSalaries

### The Problem
Forensic anthropology is a relatively young discipline, especially when compared to other subfields of anthropology. Thus, standardization of training, education, and competency remains also in its infancy in the field. To elucidate whether there are patterns to the salaries of forensic anthropologists (both housed in academic or applied institutions), a random forest analysis was conducted to illuminate which variables are weighted the most in anthropology salaries. The goal of this project is to provide early-career forensic anthropologists with greater knowledge for salary and benefit negotiations.
